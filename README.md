# Cost-Optimization
AWS Cost Optimization is the practice of managing and reducing cloud spending while maintaining the performance and scalability of your AWS environment. It involves monitoring usage, rightsizing resources, and leveraging AWS pricing models and tools to maximize value and efficiency.

Right-Sizing Resources

Analyze usage patterns to downsize over-provisioned EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other services.

Use AWS Compute Optimizer to get right-sizing recommendations.

Leverage Elasticity

Scale services up/down based on demand using Auto Scaling.

Turn off or hibernate development and test environments when not in use.

Use Appropriate Pricing Models

Reserved Instances (RIs): Commit to one or three-year terms for predictable workloads to save up to 72%.

Spot Instances: Use spare capacity at a discount (up to 90%) for fault-tolerant workloads.

Savings Plans: Flexible pricing for EC2, Lambda, and Fargate based on usage commitment.

Monitor and Analyze Spending

Use AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets to track and manage spending.

Set budget alerts and forecast future costs.

Choose the Right Storage Class

Use S3 lifecycle policies to move infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes (e.g., S3 Glacier, S3 Infrequent Access).

Consolidate Billing

Use AWS Organizations for consolidated billing to receive volume discounts across multiple accounts.

Eliminate Unused Resources

Identify and delete idle Elastic IPs, unattached EBS volumes, unused load balancers, or stale snapshots.
